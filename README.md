# Hello there! 👋

My name is Michael and I'm currently diving deep into the world of **C programming** and **Python**. I have a profound passion for **App development** and I'm always eager to learn and create.

## 📚 What I'm Learning
- C Programming: Malloc is my Warlock 😈
- Python: Easy peasy lemon squeezy 😜
- C++: Object oriented mindfucking 🥴

## 🔥 Passion
App Development has always captivated me. There's something truly exciting about turning an idea into a tangible, functional application that can enhance people's lives and steal their data.

## 📫 Reach Out!
If you have any questions, want to collaborate on a project, or just want to fight, feel free to drop me an email at **michael.o.u@outlook.com**.
For fights, meet me at the back room, and please don't tell anyone.

Thanks for stopping by!
